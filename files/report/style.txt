/sandbox/fizz_buzz.py:10:27: E226 missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
    result = [__value_of(n+1) for n in range(num_items)]
                          ^
    Surround operators with a single space on either side.

    - Always surround these binary operators with a single space on
      either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.),
      comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not),
      Booleans (and, or, not).

    - If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding
      whitespace around the operators with the lowest priorities.

/sandbox/fizz_buzz.py:18:22: W291 trailing whitespace
        return 'Buzz'
                     ^
    Trailing whitespace is superfluous.

    The warning returned varies on whether the line itself is blank,
    for easier filtering for those who want to indent their blank lines.
