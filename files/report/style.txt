/sandbox/fizz_buzz.py:10:27: E226 missing whitespace around arithmetic operator
    result = [__value_of(n+1) for n in range(num_items)]
                          ^
    Surround operators with a single space on either side.

    - Always surround these binary operators with a single space on
      either side: assignment (=), augmented assignment (+=, -= etc.),
      comparisons (==, <, >, !=, <=, >=, in, not in, is, is not),
      Booleans (and, or, not).

    - If operators with different priorities are used, consider adding
      whitespace around the operators with the lowest priorities.

    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

    There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 character
    lines; plus, limiting windows to 80 characters makes it possible to
    have several windows side-by-side.  The default wrapping on such
    devices looks ugly.  Therefore, please limit all lines to a maximum
    of 79 characters. For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or
    comments), limiting the length to 72 characters is recommended.
